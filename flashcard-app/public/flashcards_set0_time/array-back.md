**Array Time Complexity (Worst Case):**

| Operation | Dynamic Array | Static Array |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Access by index | O(1) | O(1) |
| Search | O(n) | O(n) |
| Insert at end | O(1) amortized | O(1) if space |
| Insert at beginning/middle | O(n) | O(n) |
| Delete at end | O(1) | O(1) |
| Delete at beginning/middle | O(n) | O(n) |

**Key difference:** Dynamic arrays can grow, static arrays have fixed size
