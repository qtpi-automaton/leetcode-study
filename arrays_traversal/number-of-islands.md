200. Number of Islands

**********************

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Â 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [

  ["1","1","1","1","0"],

  ["1","1","0","1","0"],

  ["1","1","0","0","0"],

  ["0","0","0","0","0"]

]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: grid = [

  ["1","1","0","0","0"],

  ["1","1","0","0","0"],

  ["0","0","1","0","0"],

  ["0","0","0","1","1"]

]

Output: 3

Â 

Constraints:

- m == grid.length

- n == grid[i].length

- 1 <= m, n <= 300

grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.**





## Solution

---

### Approach #1 DFS [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Treat the 2d grid map as an undirected graph and there is an edge  
between two horizontally or vertically adjacent nodes of value '1'.

**Algorithm**

Linear scan the 2d grid map, if a node contains a '1', then it is a root node  
that triggers a Depth First Search. During DFS, every visited node should be  
set as '0' to mark as visited node. Count the number of root nodes that trigger  
DFS, this number would be the number of islands since each DFS starting at some  
root identifies an island.



class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        if not grid:
            return 0

        num_islands = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    self.dfs(grid, i, j)
                    num_islands += 1
    
        return num_islands
    
    def dfs(self, grid, r, c):
        if (
            r < 0
            or c < 0
            or r >= len(grid)
            or c >= len(grid[0])
            or grid[r][c] != "1"
        ):
            return
        grid[r][c] = "0"
    
        self.dfs(grid, r - 1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r + 1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c - 1)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c + 1)



**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(M×N) where M is the number of rows and  
  N is the number of columns.

- Space complexity : worst case O(M×N) in case that the grid map  
  is filled with lands where DFS goes by M×N deep.

        return num_islands
        
      



**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(M×N) where M is the number of rows and  
  N is the number of columns.

- Space complexity : O(min(M,N)) because in worst case where the  
  grid is filled with lands, the size of queue can grow up to min(M,N).

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(M×N) where M is the number of rows and  
  N is the number of columns. Note that Union operation takes essentially constant  
  time[1](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/solutions/127691/number-of-islands-by-leetcode-5vu5/#user-content-fn-1) when UnionFind is implemented with both path compression and union by rank.

- Space complexity : O(M×N) as required by UnionFind data structure.
